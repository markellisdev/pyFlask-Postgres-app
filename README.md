# Flask app with Postgres database
This is a Flask app connecting to a Postgres database. It will start simple and I'd like to build it out with some future goals/concepts. It will consist of a simple form for users to submit feedback. Upon success, app owner will receive an email with simple html-formatted message contents.

## Initial Intentions - MVP - Proof of Concept
1. Simple Flask app
2. PostgreSQL database
3. User (customer) submits comment form. App owner recieves email notification. User comment is added to database

### Future goals
1. Replace front-end with React
2. Replace email confirmations with SMS notifications`
